    - compilation step creates pure HTML
    - browser re-renders into the live view
    - step is repeated for subsequent page views
    - (in server-side meaning - controller and model interact within a server process to produce new HTML views)
    - the controller and model state are maintained within the client browser
    - Therefore new pages are generated without any interaction with a server
- Quick Start (\w example)
- Bootstrap
- Directives
