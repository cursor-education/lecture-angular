 - lifecycle
  - compilation step creates pure HTML
  - browser re-renders into the live view
  - step is repeated for subsequent page views
  - (in server-side meaning - controller and model interact within a server process to produce new HTML views)
  - the controller and model state are maintained within the client browser
  - Therefore new pages are generated without any interaction with a server
- Quick Start (\w example)
- Bootstrap
- Directives
 - ng-app
  - an root element
 - ng-bind
 - ng-model

- Data Binding

- Controllers
